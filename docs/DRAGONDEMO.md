# Dragondemo - Basic Documentation of objects, and functions  

This is a basic rundown on all functions and object, their members, parameters, and algorithm throughout the demo. As i'm still learning, there might be typos or not 100% accurate definitions. Check out the Pico-8 wiki also!

<a name="player"></a>
### Player - (Object)
- `player.x`: Marks the player `x` position in pixel metrics, not tiles.
- `player.y`: Marks the player `y` position in pixel metrics, not tiles.
- `player.jump`: Defines the jump force, that's going to apply on jumping.
- `player.ax`: Defines the player's acceleration on the `x` axis.
- `player.ay`: Defines the player's acceleration on the `y` axis.
- `player.acc`: Defines the acceleration force, with which the player speeds up from stading point.
- `player.frict`: Defines the friction, that is applied to the player, to slow him down after released movement.

- `player.spr`: Contains the ID of the sprite, that is currently displayed for the player. his is the first element in that animation. The tilesheet contains two sprites for all animated objects.
- `player.walk_spr` : unused
- `player.jump_spr` : unused
- `player.hitSpr`: Contains the ID of the sprite, that is displayed if the player is damaged. This is the first element in that animation. The tilesheet contains two sprites for all animated objects.

### fireballs - (Collection)
Is a simple collection, used for globally storing all the `fireballs` in the game.
<a name="fireball"></a>
* #### fireball - (Object)
The object, that defines the fireballs in the game. These projectiles can be acquired if the player picks up a `Fireflower`. Then `player.fireballs` is incremented by `2` and now the player can shoot forward moving projectiles, that die on wall collision, and kill enemies with one shot. The player can shoot by pressing the `X` button.

## Functions
---
<a name="create_enemy"></a>
### create_enemy(x,y,type)
A function for automatic [`enemy`](#enemies) creation and handling it into the global [`enemies`](#enemies) collection.

**Parameters:**  
- `x` - `[Number]` : Defining the `x` position for the enemy on the map in pixel coordinates.
- `y` - `[Number]` : Defining the `y` position for the enemy on the map in pixel coordinates.
- `type` - `[0,1]` : Defines the type of the enemy that is to be created. `0` : Knight, `1` : Spearman. (**See more: [enemy](#enemy)**)

The function basically checks for the `type` parameter, than creates a local `enemy` object, at the given `(x,y)` position. All other members are defined by the enemy's definition. (**See more: [enemy](#enemy)**)
After it, the function add the new object into the global [`enemies`](#enemies) collection.

**Example call:**
```lua
create_enemy(80,40,0)
-- creates a Knight at (80,40) in pixel coordinates (or (10,5) in tile coordinates)
```

- `x` - `[Number]` : Defining the `x` position for the grass on the map in pixel coordinates.
- `y` - `[Number]` : Defining the `y` position for the grass on the map in pixel coordinates.

The function basically randomizes an `rng` with the
```
rng = rnd(2) + 1
```
line, than creates a local `grass` object, at the given `(x,y)` position with the randomized ID. All other members are defined by the grass's definition. (**See more: [grass](#grass)**)
After it, the function add the new object into the global [`tall_grasses`](#tall_grasses) collection.
