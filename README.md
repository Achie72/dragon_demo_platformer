PICO-8 Fooling and Learning

Generally this repository will contain my learning and experiments about the fantasy console named PICO-8.

## Dragondemo.p8
My first ever project, in which i try to implement a basic platformer, with movements, and collisions as usual. Still under development, and heavily WIP.  
Currentyl i'm not concerned about token numbers, in this project i want to focus on readability.

### Current Features
* Tile based collision check
* Global, configurable animator


[Animator based on this cartridge](https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/?tid=3115 "Simple Animation Function")  
[Collision based on this article](http://gamedev.docrobs.co.uk/first-steps-in-pico-8-easy-collisions-with-map-tiles "First Steps in PICO-8: Easy Collisions with Map Tiles")

## How to use this
* Open PICO-8 and type in `folder`. The OS will open the cartridge directory, with your dedicated file browser.
* Paste `dragondemo.p8` into the directory.
* Return to PICO-8 and press `ctrl+r` to reload.
* Type `load dragondemo.p8` and `run`.
