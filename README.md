PICO-8 Fooling and Learning

## Dragondemo.p8
My first ever project, in which i try to implement a basic platformer, with movements, and collisions as usual. Still under development, and heavily WIP.

[Collision based on this article](http://gamedev.docrobs.co.uk/first-steps-in-pico-8-easy-collisions-with-map-tiles "First Steps in PICO-8: Easy Collisions with Map Tiles")
